# Paint-Calculator-VB
A Basic Calculator to work out how much paint is required for user entered room dimensions.

I created this application using Visual Studio 2015 - Community Edition

On this GitHub you will find 3 folders, the first folder, titled "Compiled Program" contains a setup binary (for .NET Framework 4.5 if not already installed) along with the actual program, compiled by Visual Studio. The file extension is .application and should be able to be run on most windows machines. 
The Second folder, "Documentation" contains a PDF hopefully explaining the marjority of my code, how I came to it, as well as breifly covering any problems I may have experienced during development or testing.
The final folder, "Source Code" contains the actual Visual Basic project files that were generated when I originally started the program. It contains detailed comments of almost every line of code.



I learnt to use Visual Basic from a young age and have loved it ever since. I like it's simplicity, not so much because the simple is just that, "Basic" but also because in it's own way it provides a challenge to perform some task and/or create some programs that may prove easier in other development applications and programming languages.


Thank you for your interest!
